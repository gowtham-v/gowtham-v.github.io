			<li> Give some rest to your left pinkie finger which is overused for left control, in an uncomfortable position and high force
				needed to use common shortcuts like Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+T etc by remapping the Caps lock to left control. In my opinion
				it is a much less stressful position for the finger, and you barely need the Caps lock anyway. Use autohotkey or similar 
				remapping tool for this. </li>
